# If you are reading this Sid or Andy, the network.py file contains
# all of the code related to the SOFM, and should be generic to any data set

# MNISTSOFM.py acts as the controller code, and reads in the MNIST data and calls the 
# necessary functions from network.py.

# The network is also initialized in this code, so any changes you want in the network parameters
# should be found here.
